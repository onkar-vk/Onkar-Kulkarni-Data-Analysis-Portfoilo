## About

Hello there, I’m **Onkar Kulkarni** 👋

🚀 Unlocking Growth Through Data-Driven Insights:

I’m Onkar, a passionate Data Analyst with 2 years of experience in leveraging SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel to uncover trends, solve business problems, and present actionable insights. My mission is to transform raw data into compelling stories that help businesses make smarter decisions. I love figuring out the story and insights from the messy data. 

As a Data Analyst with 2 years of experience in the field of data science & analytics, accompanied by a Master’s in Business Administration from Pune University and a Google certified data analytics specialization. 
During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in current company, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
